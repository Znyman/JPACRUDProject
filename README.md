# JPACRUDProject

## Project Overview

This project, named JPACRUDProject, is a Java application that demonstrates the integration of Java Persistence API (JPA) with a Spring MVC project to perform basic CRUD operations on a MySQL database. The project follows a set of learning objectives to reinforce key concepts in database management, JPA configuration, Spring MVC integration, and AWS deployment.

## Learning Objectives

The JPACRUD application is designed to reinforce the following learning objectives:

1. **Creating a SQL Database and Tables:**
   - The project involves creating a MySQL database and the necessary tables for data manipulation.

2. **Configuring a JPA Project:**
   - Demonstrates the configuration of a JPA project to interact with the MySQL database.

3. **Mapping Entities to SQL Tables:**
   - Utilizes JPA to map Java entities to corresponding SQL tables, ensuring proper data synchronization.

4. **Creating JUnit Tests:**
   - Implements JUnit tests to validate the correctness of JPA mappings, ensuring data integrity.

5. **Integrating a Spring MVC Project:**
   - Integrates a Spring MVC project to provide a user-friendly web interface for performing CRUD operations on the database.

6. **Performing Basic CRUD Operations:**
   - Allows users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on a single entity through the Spring MVC interface.

7. **Deploying to AWS:**
   - Deploys both the project and the MySQL database to an AWS instance for remote accessibility.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Spring MVC
- Java Persistence API (JPA)
- MySQL
- JUnit
- AWS

## Project Structure

The project comprises a single table and entity, mapped to the MySQL database. JPA is used to ensure proper interaction between the Java application and the database. The Spring MVC interface facilitates user interaction with CRUD operations.
